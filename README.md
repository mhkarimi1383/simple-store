> make sure swaggo is installed `go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest`

```shell
cd api
swag init -g api.go
```

### Package Structure

- As you can see utilities are in internal package with sub packages
- also api related things are inside api package (docs package is auto generated by swaggo)
- put all of your types inside types package
- cmd package is just for initializing project using command line
